Types of prompting:
1. Zero-shot prompting- does not provide any examples
2. Few-shot prompting- provides a few examples
3. Chain of thought prompting- provides a chain of thought, multi-step reasoning 
4. Persona based prompting- provides a persona , the LLM will mimic a person 


Types of prompting styles:
1. Alpaca format: A prompt style that structures instructions, optional input, and expected response explicitly, popularized by Stanford Alpaca for instruction-tuning LLMs.
### Instruction:
<task description>

### Input:
<optional context>

### Response:
<model output>


2. ChatML format: A role-based prompt format that wraps messages with special tokens (e.g., system, user, assistant) to clearly separate conversation roles for chat-style LLMs.
<|system|>
<system instructions>
<|user|>
<user message>
<|assistant|>
<assistant response>


3. INST format: A prompt style (used by models like LLaMA-Instruct) where the user instruction is enclosed in special instruction tags to guide the model’s response behavior.
<s>[INST]
<user instruction>
[/INST]
<assistant response>
